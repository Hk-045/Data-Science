C. Count the total number of athletes in the dataset:

D. Find all records of athletes who won a Gold medal:
SELECT * FROM Olympics WHERE medal = 'Gold';

E. List all athletes who won Silver, ordered by the Year they won it:
SELECT name FROM Olympics WHERE medal = 'Silver' ORDER BY year;

F. Count how many Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals each country has won:
SELECT team, 
       COUNT(CASE WHEN medal = 'Gold' THEN 1 END) AS gold_count,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN medal = 'Silver' THEN 1 END) AS silver_count,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN medal = 'Bronze' THEN 1 END) AS bronze_count
FROM Olympics
GROUP BY team;

I. Find the athlete who has won the most medals:
SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS total_medals
FROM Olympics
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY total_medals DESC
LIMIT 1;

J. List all events that include the term 'Freestyle' in their name:
SELECT DISTINCT event
FROM Olympics
WHERE event LIKE '%Freestyle%';

K. Find the top 3 athletes by the total number of medals won in each sport:
SELECT sport, name, COUNT(*) AS total_medals
FROM Olympics
GROUP BY sport, name
ORDER BY total_medals DESC
LIMIT 3;

L. List athletes who won more than one medal in a single Olympic year:
SELECT name, year, COUNT(*) AS total_medals
FROM Olympics
GROUP BY name, year
HAVING total_medals > 1;

M. Identify countries that have won gold medals in both Summer and Winter Olympics:
SELECT team
FROM Olympics
GROUP BY team
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT season) = 2
AND COUNT(CASE WHEN medal = 'Gold' THEN 1 END) > 0;

N. Show the year difference between the first and last medal won by each country:
SELECT team, 
       MAX(year) - MIN(year) AS year_difference
FROM Olympics
GROUP BY team;

P. Identify athletes who have won a silver medal and then later won a gold in the same event:
SELECT DISTINCT o1.name
FROM Olympics o1
JOIN Olympics o2 ON o1.name = o2.name AND o1.event = o2.event
WHERE o1.medal = 'Silver' AND o2.medal = 'Gold';


T. Find athletes who won medals in three consecutive Olympic games in the same event:
SELECT name, sport, MIN(year) AS start_year
FROM Olympics
GROUP BY name, sport
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT year) >= 3;

       COUNT(*) / COUNT(DISTINCT name) AS avg_medals_per_athlete
FROM Olympics
GROUP BY team;
